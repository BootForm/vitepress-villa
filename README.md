# A villa or holiday rental site for VitePress

A villa listing without a working way to actually get booked is just a brochure. This template
builds a home page, a room-by-room breakdown, a photo gallery, a local guide (blog), and a
booking enquiry form that actually reaches you, with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev).

**[See what you are building →](https://bootform.github.io/vitepress-villa/)**

## Before you start

You need:

- A free GitHub account.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20 or later installed on your computer.
- Some comfort with a terminal. `git clone`, `npm install`, `npm run dev`, that level.

Don't have some of this yet, or not sure how? [Setting up your
computer](https://bootform.com/docs/computer-setup) walks through installing Git and Node.js, a
basic terminal tutorial, and installing and using VS Code, from scratch.

If any of that sounds like too much right now, [first-website](https://github.com/BootForm/first-website)
needs none of it and still ends with a real site and a working form.

## Step 1: Make your own copy

Click **Use this template**, then **Create a new repository**. Name it `vitepress-villa`, or
whatever you like.

> **Naming it something other than `vitepress-villa`?** Open `docs/.vitepress/config.mts` and
> change `base: '/vitepress-villa/'` (and the favicon path under `head`, in the same file) to match (`/your-repo-name/`), and do the same for `SITE_URL`
> in `scripts/generate-rss.mjs`. Get either wrong and the site (or its RSS feed) looks broken in a
> way that only shows up once deployed, not in `npm run dev`.

Then clone *your* new repository to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/vitepress-villa.git
cd vitepress-villa
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the address it prints. That's your site, running on your own computer. It still says Five
Palms Villa. We'll fix that next.

---

## Step 2: Make it yours

Look for the lines marked `CHANGE ME`, across a few files:

- **`docs/.vitepress/config.mts`**: your villa's name, description, and the nav links.
- **`docs/public/logo.svg`**: your logo. Replace the file itself and it updates in both the header
  and the footer.
- **`docs/.vitepress/theme/style.css`**: your brand colour. One value, used everywhere.
- **`docs/index.md`**: the home page hero (photo, name, tagline), the facilities grid, and the FAQ.
  The rooms teaser below them is generated: it doesn't need editing when you add or remove a room.
- **`docs/rooms/*.md`**: five example rooms. Each one's frontmatter (`name`, `description`,
  `image`, `sleeps`, `bed`, `view`, `order`) is what shows on its card and its own page.
- **`docs/gallery.md`**: swap `docs/public/gallery/*.jpg` for your own photos, and add or remove
  `<img>` lines to match how many you have.
- **`docs/posts/*.md`**: two example journal posts (local guides). The [same generated post list,
  tags, and RSS feed as `vitepress-blog`](https://github.com/BootForm/vitepress-blog); see that
  template's own README for how adding a post works, since it's identical here.
- **`docs/contact.md`**: the location, phone/WhatsApp, and email in the left-hand info column.

**Adding a new room:** copy one of the example files, change its frontmatter and body, and you're
done. It appears as a card on both the home page and the Rooms page automatically.

The images that ship with this template are real photos, not mockups: free-to-use ([Unsplash
License](https://unsplash.com/license), via [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos)), so the demo
looks like a real site, but they're standing in for actual photos of your own property. Replace
them before this goes live.

> **Picking a colour is the hard part.** If you have no idea, `--color-brand-500: #2563eb` (a
> plain blue) is a safe default.

---

## Step 3: Make the contact form actually work

Here is the bit most tutorials skip.

A static site has no program running behind it, so there is nowhere for a form to send anything.
We will use [BootForm](https://bootform.com), because you can point a form at it and it works
immediately, with no account.

**3a. Generate your form ID.**

It is just a random UUID, and it has to be yours alone. Open BootForm's own [UUID
generator](https://bootform.com/uuidgenerator) and copy what it shows you (or run
`crypto.randomUUID()` in any browser console). You'll get something like
`11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111`, though a real one won't repeat digits like that.

> **Use your own.** Do not use the one printed above, and do not use a friend's. Whoever claims a
> form ID first owns it, and everything sent to it goes to them. Yours should be a fresh random one
> that nobody else has seen.

**3b. Paste it into `docs/contact.md`**, replacing `__YOUR_FORM_ID__` in the `action` attribute.

**3c. Try it, then claim it** at the claim link it gives you, **before** the site goes live
publicly. Held submissions are kept for 48 hours before they're deleted.

---

## Step 4: Deploy it

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Make it mine"
git push
```

In your repository, **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions** (not "deploy from a branch").
The included workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) builds and deploys on every push to `main`.

**Optional: a real domain.** The same steps as
[one-page-site's Step 5](https://github.com/BootForm/one-page-site#step-5-put-it-on-your-own-domain)
apply here: a `CNAME` file in `docs/public/`, DNS records at your registrar, then **Enforce HTTPS**
in the same Pages settings. Also change `base: '/vitepress-villa/'` to `base: '/'` in
`docs/.vitepress/config.mts` and `SITE_URL` in `scripts/generate-rss.mjs`, since a custom domain
serves from the root, not a subpath.

---

## That's it

You have a real villa site, with rooms, a gallery, a local guide, and a working booking enquiry
form, built the way VitePress is meant to be used for this, not the docs-site defaults.

### Where to go next

- [`site-skills`](https://github.com/BootForm/site-skills) if you use Claude Code: commands to add
  page sections, add a new kind of content (books, team members, events), change the theme and
  swap icons, all following this template's conventions.
- [`site-sections`](https://bootform.github.io/site-sections/) for copy-paste page sections (heroes,
  pricing, FAQs, footers) that survive VitePress's own styles.
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) if you're working on this with an AI coding agent: the conventions this
  template follows, and the gotchas already hit building it.
- [`vitepress-blog`](https://github.com/BootForm/vitepress-blog) for more on how the journal's
  generated post list, tags, and RSS actually work.
- [`form-styles`](https://bootform.github.io/form-styles/) for more input types and layouts to
  style the contact form with.
